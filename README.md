# ResetRBX
One applcation to reset Roblox while keeping your settings

Made in C#

Deletes Game/ Experience visit history, accounts used history, previous Roblox verions, local Roblox logs and game assets.

Why use this?
This tool is quicker than manully uninstalling and reinstalling Roblox also this tool totally wipes everything to do with roblox (execpt the regkeys) from your computer while the uninstaller for Roblox does not do this and leaves the roblox files on your computer.

I am aware of the detection rate on Virustotal and i am manually submitting the file to antimalware companies in order to get the detections removed Microsoft and Avast have whitelisted/ removed it already and I am waiting for others to get back to me in the mean time you will have to add an exception for it in your antimalware settings.
